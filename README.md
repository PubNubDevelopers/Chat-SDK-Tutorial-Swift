## Installation / Getting Started

This application is written with Xcode 16.0 but should compile with any recent version of Xcode.

To run this project yourself you will need a PubNub Account

### Get Your PubNub Keys

1. Youâ€™ll first need to sign up for a [PubNub account](https://admin.pubnub.com/signup/). Once you sign up, you can get your unique PubNub keys from the [PubNub Developer Portal](https://admin.pubnub.com/).

1. Sign in to your [PubNub Dashboard](https://admin.pubnub.com/).

1. Click Apps, then **Create New App**.

1. Give your app a name, and click **Create**.

1. Click your new app to open its settings, then click its keyset.

1. Enable the Stream Controller feature on your keyset (this should be enabled by default after you created the keyset)

1. Enable the Message Persistence feature on your keyset and choose a duration

1. Enable the App Context feature on your keyset.

1. Leave the File Sharing feature disabled.  Although the Chat SDK supports sending files, this demo app does not.

1. Copy the Publish and Subscribe keys and paste them into your app as specified in the next step.

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository

1. Open the file `/PubNubSwiftChatSDKTutorial/PubNubSwiftChatSDKTutorial/Keys.swift`

1. Modify the strings `YOUR_PUBLISH_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_SUBSCRIBE_KEY_HERE`, replacing them with your PubNub Publish and Subscribe keys.

Compile and run the application

## Using the Application

At the login screen choose a name.  This is a free form field and you don't need to register for an account or create a password.  Behind the scenes, a PubNub user ID is created based on your chosen name.
